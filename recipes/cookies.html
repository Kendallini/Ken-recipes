        <ul>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup dark brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup smart balance</li>
            <li>¼ cup non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>8 oz vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, salt, and coconut oil until combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk in non-dairy milk and vanilla, until all sugar has dissolved and the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly.</li>
            <li>Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Be sure to leave at least 2 inches of space between cookies and the edges of the pan so cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until cookies just begin to brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

            <li>1 cup|237 ml coconut milk (can use soy milk)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black salt (or regular salt)</li>
            <li>½ cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup + 2 tablespoons|90 ml coconut oil, liquidated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 ½ to 2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 375°F. Line a muffin tin with baking cups and set aside. </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine lemon juice and coconut or soy milk. Set aside to allow milk to curdle (curdle effect will be better with soy milk).</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a third large bowl, mix together the sugar, coconut oil, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Add coconut milk/lemon juice mixture and stir to combine. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until well incorporated, but do not over-mix – a few lumps are okay. Gently fold in the blueberries.</li>
            <li>Spoon mixture into muffin tins, filling each cup about ¾ full. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow muffins to cool before removing from pan.</li>
        </ol>
